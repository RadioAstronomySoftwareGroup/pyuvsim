Parameter and configuration Files
=================================

When running simulations from yaml and csv files, there are four configuration files
that must be used.

The outermost parameter file is the ``obsparam_*.yaml``, which is parsed by
:func:`pyuvsim.simsetup.initialize_uvdata_from_params` into a :class:`pyuvdata.UVData` object,
a beam dictionary, and a :class:`pyuvsim.BeamList` object.

The antenna layout and telescope config yaml files determine the full properties of the
array, including location, beam models, layout, and naming.

The catalog text files give point source lists.


These files contain overall simulation parameters. See :doc:`usage` for details on how
these are passed into a simulation.

**Note** The example above is shown with all allowed keywords, but many of these are
redundant. This will be further explained below. Only one source catalog will be used
at a time.

Filing
^^^^^^
    Specifies where the results file will be output, what name the file should have,
    and whether or not to overwrite existing files. None of these parameters are required.

Frequency
^^^^^^^^^

    As is the standard with ``pyuvdata``, the frequency channel numbers refer to the
    **frequency at the channel center**. The ``bandpass`` refers to the total band
    covered by all channels, and the channel width is the separation between channel
    centers. Therefore, the following relations hold::

		bandpass = Nfreqs * channel_width
		bandpass = (end_freq + channel_width/2.) - (start_freq - channel_width/2.) = ( end_freq - start_freq) + channel_width
		start_freq = end_freq - bandpass + channel_width
		end_freq = start_freq + bandpass - channel_width


    Time and frequency structure may be defined with different combinations of keywords
    to suit the user's purposes. The user must specify sufficient information for the
    frequency array to be defined.

    Minimum frequency requirements:

    Specify bandwidth via one of the following combinations:

        * (``start_freq``, ``end_freq``)
        * (``channel_width``, ``Nfreqs``)
        * (``bandwidth``)

    Specify channel width via:

        * (``bandwidth``, ``Nfreqs``)
        * (``channel width``)

    Specify a reference frequency via:

        * (``start_freq``)
        * (``end_freq``)

    As long as one of the sets from each category above is met by the supplied
    keywords, the frequency array will be successfully built.
    You can also just give an explicit ``freq_array``.

    The ``channel_width`` should be specified as a scalar unless ``freq_array`` is specified,
    in which case ``channel_width`` can either be a scalar or an array of the same
    length as ``freq_array``.

    If you specify an explicit ``freq_array`` that is not evenly spaced or is only
    length one, you must specify the ``channel_width``, either as a single value (in Hz)
    or as an array of the same length as ``freq_array``.

Time
^^^^

    The time array is specified similarly. The entries in the ``time_array`` indicate the
    **center of each time step in Julian date**. The ``integration_time`` is the time
    step size in seconds. The user may also specify ``duration_hours`` or ``duration_days``
    to specify the total time covered by all time steps. The following relations among
    parameters hold::

        duration_hours = Ntimes * integration_time / (3600.)
        duration_days = duration_hours / 24.
        duration_days = (end_time - start_time) + integration_time / 86400
        start_time = end_time - duration_days + integration_time / 86400
        end_time = start_time + duration_days - integration_time / 86400

    The numerical factors are to convert among seconds, days, and hours. The user must
    specify sufficient information for the time array to be defined:

    Minimum time requirements:

    Total time:

        * (``start_time``, ``end_time``)
        * (``integration_time``, ``Ntimes``)
        * (``duration_hours``) or (``duration_days``)

    Time step:

        * (``duration_hours`` or ``duration_days``, ``Ntimes``)
        * (``integration_time``)

    Reference time:

        * (``start_time``)
        * (``end_time``)

    As long as one of the sets from each category above is met by the supplied keywords,
    the time array will be successfully built.



Telescope Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    Under the telescope section, the keywords ``array_layout`` and ``telescope_config_name``
    give paths to, respectively, the array layout text file and the telescope metadata
    configuration yaml file. These path may either be absolute or specified relative
    to the location of the obsparam yaml file.

    Example array layout with four antennas:

    .. literalinclude:: example_configs/baseline_lite.csv

    Columns here provide, in order from left to right, the antenna name, antenna number,
    a beam ID number, and the antenna positions relative to the array center in
    east, north, up (ENU) in meters. The layout file has a corresponding telescope
    metadata file, shown below:

    .. literalinclude:: example_configs/bl_lite_mixed.yaml

    This yaml file provides the telescope name, location in latitude/longitude/altitude
    in degrees/degrees/meters (respectively), and the beam dictionary
    (the ``beam_paths`` section).
    In this case we have 5 different types of beams with beam IDs running from
    0 to 4:

      - 0: a UVBeam from the file `hera.beamfits`
      - 1: a UVBeam (for the MWA) with some keywords specified to pass to ``UVBeam.read``
      - 2: an analytic Airy disk with diameter 16 m
      - 3: an analytic Gaussian beam with sigma 0.03 radians (for the E-Field beam)
      - 4: an analytic Gaussian with diameter 14 m

    The parameters for each beam depends on whether it is a UVBeam or an analytic
    beam. UVBeams must have a `filename` parameter and they can optionally have
    any other parameter that can be passed to the ``UVBeam.read`` method.
    Analytic beams must have a `type` parameter and can have parameters specifying
    shapes as appropriate for their type.
    The dictionary only needs to be as long as the number of unique beams used
    in the array, while the layout file specifies which antennas will use which
    beam type. This allows for a mixture of beams to be used, as in this example.
    Unassigned beams will be ignored (the given layout file only uses beamIDs 0 and 2).

    Analytic beams may require shape parameters depending on their type.

    - airy: Airy disk (ie, diffraction pattern of a circular aperture). Requires an
      antenna diameter and is inherently chromatic.
    - gaussian: Gaussian function shaped beam. Requires either an antenna `diameter`
      (in meters) or a standard deviation `sigma` (in radians). Gaussian beams
      specified by a diameter will have their width matched to an Airy beam at
      each simulated frequency, so are inherently chromatic. For Gaussian beams
      specified with `sigma`, `sigma` sets the width of the E-Field beam in zenith angle.
      If only `sigma` is specified, the beam is achromatic, optionally both the
      `spectral_index` and `reference_frequency` parameters can be set to generate
      a chromatic beam with standard deviation defined by a power law:
      `stddev(f) = sigma * (f/ref_freq)**(spectral_index)`
    - uniform: The same response in all directions. No additional parameters.

    There are also some global parameters that apply to all the UVBeams:

      - `freq_interp_kind` sets the type of frequency interpolation for all UVBeam
        objects defined in the beam list (see documentation on UVBeam for options).

      - The `spline_interp_opts` keyword lets the user set the order on the angular
        interpolating polynomial spline function. By default, it is cubic.

      - The `select` section allows for doing partial reading UVBeam files.
        This can include any selection parameter accepted by UVBeam.read.
        It can also take a `freq_buffer` parameter which is used to set the
        `freq_range` on read so that only frequencies within `freq_buffer` of the
        min and max of the simulated frequencies will be read during setup. This
        can help reduce peak memory usage. Note that if any of the same `select`
        parameters are passed for a specific UVBeam and to the `select` section,
        the values passed for the specific UVBeam will supercede the values in the
        `select` section.

    The figure below shows the array created by these configurations, with beam type
    indicated by color.

Telescopes on the Moon
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   If the ``lunarsky`` module is installed, the ``telescope_location`` can be interpreted as the
   lon/lat/alt of an observatory on the Moon, defined in the "Mean Earth/ Mean Rotation"
   frame (see documentation on ``lunarsky``). Setting the keyword ``world: moon`` in the
   telescope_config file enables this. Optionally set the ``lunar_ellipsoid`` keyword
   to specify which reference ellipsoid to use (it defaults to "SPHERE"). Must be one of
   "SPHERE", "GSFC", "GRAIL23", "CE-1-LAM-GEO" (see ``lunarsky`` package for details).

   .. literalinclude:: example_configs/tranquility_config.yaml


Sources
^^^^^^^
    Specify the path to a catalog file via ``catalog``. The path can be given as an
    absolute path or relative to the location of the obsparam. This catalog can be any
    file type that is readable with ``pyradiosky``. pyradiosky's SkyModel
    (`SkyModel <https://pyradiosky.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`__)
    supports a wide range of catalogs, including point sources and diffuse maps
    and multiple spectral models.

    An example text catalog file:

    .. literalinclude:: ../pyuvsim/data/mock_catalog_heratext_2458098.27471265.txt
        :lines: 1-5

    The columns are:

        * ``source_id`` : Identifier for the source
        * ``ra_icrs`` : Right ascension of source in decimal degrees in the ICRS frame.
          Other frames are supported, e.g. ``ra_J2000`` would yield an FK5 frame at the J2000 epoch.
          See ``pyradiosky`` docs for more details on frame specification.
        * ``dec_icrs`` : Declination of source  in decimal degrees in the ICRS frame.
          Other frames are supported, e.g. ``dec_J2000`` would yield an FK5 frame at the J2000 epoch.
          See ``pyradiosky`` docs for more details on frame specification.
        * ``Flux``: Source stokes I brightness in Janskies.  (Currently only point sources are supported).
        * ``Frequency``: A reference frequency for the given flux. This will be used for spectral modeling.

    If the catalog is a GLEAM VO table file, optionally specify the ``spectral_type``
    as one of: ``flat``, ``subband`` or ``spectral_index``. If not specified it defaults
    to ``flat``.

    If the catalog is a different VO table file, several other keywords are required or recommended:

      * ``table_name`` : The name of the table to use from the file (required).
      * ``id_column`` : The name of the column to use for the source IDs (required).
      * ``flux_columns`` : One or a list of columns to use for the source fluxes
        (a list for fluxes at multiple frequencies) (required).
      * ``lon_column`` : The name of the column to use for the source longitudes (required, ``ra_column`` is a deprecated synonym)
      * ``lat_column`` : The name of the column to use for the source latitudes (required, ``ra_column`` is a deprecated synonym).
      * ``frame`` : The name of the ``astropy`` frame to use.

    Optionally specify the ``filetype`` as one of ['skyh5', 'gleam', 'vot', 'text', 'hdf5'].
    If this is not specified, the code attempts to guess what file type it is.

    Alternatively, you can specify a ``mock`` and provide the ``mock_arrangement``
    keyword to specify which mock catalog to generate. Available options are shown
    in the :func:`pyuvsim.simsetup.create_mock_catalog` docstring.

    Flux limits can be made by providing the keywords ``min_flux`` and ``max_flux``.
    These specify the min/max stokes I flux to choose from the catalog.

    The option ``horizon_buffer`` can be set (in radians) to adjust the tolerance on the
    coarse horizon cut. After reading in the catalog, ``pyuvsim`` roughly calculates the
    rise and set times (in local sidereal time, in radians) for each source. If the
    source never rises, it is excluded from the simulation, and if the source never sets
    its rise/set times are set to None. This calculation is less accurate than the
    astropy alt/az calculation used in the main task loop, so a "buffer" angle is added
    to the set lst (and subtracted from the rise lst) to ensure sources aren't
    accidentally excluded. Tests indicate that a 10 minute buffer is sufficient.
    Pyuvsim also excludes sources below the horizon after calculating their AltAz
    coordinates, which is more accurate. The coarse cut is only to reduce computational load.

Select
^^^^^^
    Specify keywords to select which baselines to simulate. The selection is done by
    UVData.select, so it can accept any keyword that function accepts, except ones that
    affect polarization because pyuvsim computes all polarizations.

    Note that if using the ``bls`` parameter for selecting, which specifies a list of
    baseline tuples, the list needs to be wrapped in a string in the obsparam yaml file.

    In addition to the UVData.select keywords, a ``redundant_threshold`` parameter can
    be specified. If it is present, only one baseline from each set of redundant
    baselines is simulated. The ``redundant_threshold`` specifies how different two
    baseline vectors can be to still be called redundant -- the magnitude of the vector
    differences must be less than or equal to the threshold. The vector differences are
    calculated for a phase center of zenith (i.e. in drift mode).
